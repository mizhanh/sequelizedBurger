### Overview

Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.  Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* Rather than using the customize ORM, this app leveraged Sequelize NPM to create the models.  Node, Express, Handlebars NPMs were also used in the development of the app.
